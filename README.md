# flappyBird
Flappy Bird style game made with Javascript.
I made this a few years ago using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.
The game currently works best on mobile devices.


Upcoming fixes, 10-27-2023:
I plan to make a couple short-term changes, such as separating the CSS and JS into independant files.
Several Variables need updating, and some number values need to be reassigned as variables.
Screen responsiveness needs updating based on user's screen size.
Pipes and player need to move in percentages instead of pixels, to make gameplay more consistent across devices.
