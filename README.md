# flappyBird
Flappy Bird style game made with Javascript.
I made this a few years ago using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript.
The game currently works best on mobile devices.

I plan to make a couple short-term changes, such as separating the CSS and JS into independant files.
Several Variables need updating, and some number values need to be assigned as variables.
